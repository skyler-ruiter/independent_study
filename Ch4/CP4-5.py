"""

(a) Use a library routine to compute the eigenvalues of the matrix:

    [   9 4.5  3  ]
A = [ -56 -28 -18 ]
    [  60  30  19 ]

    
(b) Compute the eigenvalues of the same matrix again, except with the 
a_33 entry changed to 18.95. What is the relative change in magnitudes 
of the eigenvalues?


(c) Compute the eigenvalues of the same matrix again, except with the 
a_33 entry changed to 19.05. What is the relative change in magnitudes 
of the eigenvalues?


(d) What conclusion can you draw about the conditioning of the eigenvalues 
of A? Compute an appropriate condition number or condition numbers to 
explain this behavior.
