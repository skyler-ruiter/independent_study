/*
(a) Write a program to compute the approximate value for
the derivative of a function using the finite difference formula:

  f'(x) = (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h

Test your program using the function tan(x) for x=1. Determine the 
error by comparing with the square of the built-in function sec(x).
Plot h = 10^-k, k = 0, ..., 16. You should use log scale for h and
for the magnitude of the error. Is there a minimum value for the 
magnitude of the error? How does the corresponding value for h compare
with the rule of thumb h approx is sqrt(machine epsilon) derived in
example 1.3?

(b) Repeat the exercise using the centered difference approximation:

  f'(x) = (f(x+h) - f(x-h)) / 2h
