/*
Suppose you need to generate n+1 equally spaced points on the interval
[a,b], with spacing h = (b-a)/n.

(a) In floating-point arithmetic, which of the following methods:
    x_0 = a,  x_k = x_(k-1) + h,    k = 1, ..., n
or
    x_k = a + kh,   k = 0, ..., n
is better, and why?

(b) Write a program implementing both methods nd find an example, 
say, with a = 0 and b = 1, that illustrates the difference between them.
