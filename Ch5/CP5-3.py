"""

Implement the bisection, Newton, and secant methods for solving 
nonlinear equations in one dimension, and test your implementations 
by finding at least one root for each of the following equations. 
What termination criterion should you use? What convergence rate is 
achieved in each case? Compare your results (solutions and 
convergence rates) with those for a library routine for solving 
nonlinear equations.

  (a) x^3 - 2x - 5 = 0.
  (b) e^-x = x.
  (c) xsin(x) = 1.
  (d) x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0.
