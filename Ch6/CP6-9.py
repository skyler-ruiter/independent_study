"""

Write a program to find a minimum of Rosenbrock's function:

f(x, y) = 100(y - x^2)^2 + (1 - x)^2

using each of the following methods:

(a) Steepest descent
(b) Newton
(c) Damped Newton (Newton's method with a line search)


You should try each of the methods from each of the three starting 
points [-1 1]^T , [0 1]^T , and [2 1]^T . For any line searches 
and linear system solutions required, you may use either library 
routines or routines of your own design. Plot the path taken in the 
plane by the approximate solutions for each method from each starting point.
